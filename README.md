## BLACKPHENIX - MALWARE ANALYSIS + AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK

BLACKPHENIX is an open source malware analysis automation framework composed of several services, scripts, plug-ins, and tools and is based on a Command-and-Control (C&C) architecture.

This framework was released and presented at <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/arsenal/schedule/#blackphenix-malware-analysis--automation-framework-16941" target="_blank">BlackHat Arsenal 2019</a> 

## How this framework can be used?
A malware analyst can leverage the framework to automate common malware analysis tasks by developing tool automation scripts (BPH Scripts) and data analysis modules (BPH Analysis Modules) that operate in the context of malware execution.

BPH Scripts control execution and reporting of well-known analysis tools, custom programs, and scripts that run on a virtual machine, whilst “BPH Analysis Modules” focus on data parsing, extraction, and analysis.

For more information, please refer to the framework's documentation.
